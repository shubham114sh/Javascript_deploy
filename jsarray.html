	<h1>Array Excercise</h1>
	<h2>Welcome to the class roster exercise!</h2>
	<p>For this exercise you will be making a very simple web app that contains an array of student names in a .js file. The website will prompt you for four possible commands: add,remove,display, and quit. This web page will prompt the user for one of the commands. Here is what each command should do:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>add: will then create a prompt for a student name request. Then add this name to the student to the array of student names in the .js file</li>
		<li>remove: will create a prompt for a student name request. Then remove this name from the roster array</li>
		<li>display: will print out the roster using console.log</li>
		<li>quit:will end the while loop of prompts.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Watch the lecture video for an example of how it should work. Also make sure to change the script src file to your own .js file!</p>
